This software is still in development


## 2. Setup for use **Without** Software 

The Keypad can be used with or without the Vitalll Studio software provided. The software is not necessary but it provides access to many useful features, including:

       Global Video and Mic Mute
       LED inicators
       Custom Shortcuts
       Customizability 

> [!NOTE]
> To use the keypad without software, shortcuts within the video meeting program used have to be changed. Not every program has the option to do this, so some programs will require the Vitall Studio software. 


Commonly used supported programs that can be used without software:

       Zoom Meetings

### Setup Process for Zoom

### Setup Process for Other Programs

The keypad can be used without software with any program that allows for shortcut customization. To do this, find the shortcut customization menu in your program's settings, and click the keys on the keypad to act as the new shortcuts. Use the zoom instructions for a rough guide, or message me with any questions or issues. The new shortcuts should be: F13, F14, F15, F16, from left to right on the keypad.
