## Setup for use **Without** Software 

The Keypad can be used with or without the Vitalll Studio 1111software provided. The software is not neccessary but it provides access to many useful features, inluding:

       Global Video and Mic Mute
       LED inicators
       Custom Shortcuts
       Customizability 

To use the keypad without software, shortcuts within the video meeting program used have to be changed. Not every program has the option to do this, so some programs will require the Vitall Studio software. 

Commonly used supported programs that can be used without software:

       Zoom Meetongs
